    "> In this lab, I will be using WorldBank's 2017 GDP data to determine a few things. I want to find the average GDP of every country, as well as the minimum and maximum GDP's. I'm specifically curious to see whether the U.S. has the highest GDP of any country. I also want to see whether or not the lowest GDP is shockingly low or not. Finally, I'm curious whether or not the average GDP is comparable to other country's GDP's (such as the mininum and maximum GDP)."

    "> Cleaning the data was should be fairly straightforward, as it was when I did this lab without Pandas. I have currently spend over an hour trying to figure out how to drop the various groups of countries, because for whatever godforsaken reason Pandas just does not want to drop rows. Even though dropping rows is instrumental to this lab's validity, I have to call it quits. It's absolutely insane that neither of the two lines listed below actually drop the rows, as that is what everyone says should work (https://chrisalbon.com/python/data_wrangling/pandas_dropping_column_and_rows/). I genuinely cannot take more time on this lab, especially when the actual data has already been analyzed and this is a re-write.\n",
    "\n",
    "> I am aware that the data could be cleaned in Excel beforehand, but I strongly think that all cleaning should be done in code so that this lab can be easily reproduced. Furthermore, me cleaning the data in Excel is a step backwards, and I want to expose the apparent issue with Pandas. If you want to see cleaned data with code, check out Lab 2."
